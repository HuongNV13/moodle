This file describes API changes in the accessibilitychecker Tiny plugin code.

=== 4.2 ===

* We created a list of ignored classes in plugininfo::get_plugin_configuration_for_context(), so all the elements have at least one of these classes will not be assessed
  by the accessibility checker plugin.
* New tiny_accessibilitychecker/options::getIgnoredClassesName() function has been created to get the list of ignored classes
* New tiny_accessibilitychecker/options::addIgnoredClassName() function has been created to allow other plugins that want their elements not to be assessed by the accessibility
  checker adding their ignored classes to the list.
